QCD as the Origin of Mass Derivation

10.1.1 General Relativity establishes that gravitational fields manifest as metric perturbations→spacetime curvature.

10.1.2 Mass must therefore induce localized spacetime distortion→creating the observed gravitational potential.

10.1.3 This implies mass itself represents a condensed form of spacetime deformation →self-consistent with stress-energy sourcing curvature.

10.1.4 Within hadrons, quark-gluon dynamics are governed by SU(3) color interactions→the dominant force compressing spatial quanta (SEQ).

10.1.5 Thus, SU(3)-mediated compression of SEQ networks → generates both quark confinement energy (mass) and external spacetime stretching (gravity).

10.1.6 Generalizing this mechanism→ equivalent effects (velocity/acceleration) anisotropically compress local space→inducing equivalent gravitational attraction via adjacent SEQ tension.
