10.6 The essence of mass

The essence of mass is the storage of gravitational (spatial elastic) potential energy under the interaction of SU(3) corresponding to the compression of space.

10.6.1 Dimensional analysis dictates that the relationship between mass and energy must satisfy [E]/[m][v²], with the proportionality coefficient determined by the fundamental constants of spacetime (the speed of light, c).

10.6.2 The compressed potential energy of mass in localized space is inherently mainly released as gravitational waves with radiation, which propagate at speed c , thus directly yielding △E=△mc².
